<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The C++ program featured in this tutorial web page implements a custom data type (i.e. <strong>class</strong>) named <strong>TRIANGLE</strong>. Each TRIANGLE type variable (i.e. TRIANGLE type <strong>object</strong>) represents exactly three unique Cartesian plane coordinate pairs (and each one of those coordinate pairs is represented by a unique <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/point_object/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POINT</a> type object).</span></p>

<p>Object Oriented Programming Terminology: The POINT class definition is included in the TRIANGLE class definition through <strong>composition</strong> (i.e. containing data members whose data type is some other class) rather than through <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/polygon_object/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inheritance</a> (i.e. inheriting the <strong>protected</strong> and <strong>public</strong> members of some parent class)</p>
<pre>public -&gt; accessible to any program scope.
protected -&gt; accessible only to child classes and to clone classes.
private -&gt; accessible only to clone classes.
</pre>
<p>The data attributes of a TRIANGLE object are three POINT type objects named A, B, and C (and the coordinate pair which <strong>A</strong> represents is not the same coordinate pair which either B or C represents (and the coordinate pair which <strong>B</strong> represents is not the same coordinate pair which either A or C represents (and the coordinate pair which <strong>C</strong> represents is not the same coordinate pair which either A or B represents))).</p>

<p><strong>Program Compilation &amp; Execution</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste each of the following C++ code files into a new text editor document and save each  document as its respective file name:</p>
<pre>point.h</pre>
<pre>point.cpp</pre>
<pre>triangle.h</pre>
<pre>triangle.cpp</pre>
<pre>triangle_driver.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a Unix command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ triangle_driver.cpp triangle.cpp point.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following command to install the C++ compiler:</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_ultimate_starter_pack/blob/main/triangle_driver_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

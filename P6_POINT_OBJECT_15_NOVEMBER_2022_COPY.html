<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The C++ program featured in this tutorial web page implements a custom data type (i.e. <strong>class</strong>) named <strong>POINT</strong>. Each POINT type variable (i.e. POINT type <strong>object</strong>) represents exactly one Cartesian plane coordinate pair.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>To view hidden text inside of the preformatted text boxes below, scroll horizontally.</em></strong></p>
<pre>class : object :: data_type : variable.</pre>
<p>Each POINT object has an int type variable named <strong>X</strong> which represents a whole number position along the horizontal axis of the Cartesian plane.</p>
<p>Each POINT object has an int type variable named <strong>Y</strong> which represents a whole number position along the vertical axis of the Cartesian plane.</p>

<p><strong>Program Compilation &amp; Execution</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste each of the following C++ code files into a new text editor document and save each  document as its respective file name:</p>
<pre>point.h</pre>
<pre>point.cpp</pre>
<pre>point_driver.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a Unix command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ point_driver.cpp point.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following command to install the C++ compiler:</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_ultimate_starter_pack/blob/main/point_driver_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

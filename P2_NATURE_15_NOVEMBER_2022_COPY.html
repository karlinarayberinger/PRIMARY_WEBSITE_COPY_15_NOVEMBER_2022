<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe <strong>nature</strong> as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PURE_NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous, featureless, irreducible, and immutable substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific features (and those features are observed as being nonzero and finite <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantities</a> of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a> (and if there exists a nonzero and finite amount of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> within that finite region of space, the pieces of matter which that space contains is observed as transmitting or storing nonzero and finite quantities of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a> (and energy is transmitted from one piece of matter to some other piece of matter when those pieces of matter touch each other))).</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is the observation of <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">red</strong> light which is being emitted from a single <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light-emitting diode</a> by a human nervous system which is processing input signals from optic nerves detecting light whose wavelengths are approximately 700 nanometers. (Where the color red is being observed by some partial frame of reference is where other colors such as <strong style="background:#000000;color:#0000ff;">blue</strong> (i.e. the observation of light whose wavelengths are approximately 450 nanometers) and <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">green</strong> (i.e. the observation of light whose wavelengths are approximately 560 nanometers) are not simultaneously being observed by that same partial frame of reference (specifically in the case of a single light-emitting diode outputting exactly one wavelength of light at a time to the exclusion of all other wavelengths of light)).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">Note that in order for an information processing agent to register an image from incoming light, a sound from incoming vibrations through some kind of sufficiently dense material, or some other sensory experience (and a sensory experience is a type of phenomenon), <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work</a> must be performed which means that energy must be transmitted across some nonzero and finite region of space (and the process of an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> converting incoming “low level” signals from its environment to “high level” subjective qualia requires that some nonzero and finite amount of time elapses (which suggests that omniscience might not be physically possible and that phenomena can only be experienced from partial rather than omniscient frames of reference)).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> a particular allocation of pure nothingness which renders a particular set of phenomena.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PARTIAL_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders some phenomena but not all phenomena.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>OMNISCIENT_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders all phenomena simultaneously.</p>
<p>At minimum, an omniscient frame of reference would render each partial frame of reference which currently exists simultaneously for as long as that omniscient frame of reference exists.</p>
<p>At maximum, an omniscient frame of reference would render each noumenon as that noumenon’s uniquely corresponding phenomenon eternally (such that the omniscient frame of reference would contain <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many unique phenomena and infinitely many copies of each unique phenomenon).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that partial frame of reference).</p>
<p>For example, while a partial frame of reference named A renders a finite set of phenomena named X, another partial frame of reference named B renders a finite set of phenomena named Y (and X and Y are phenomenally distinct). From A’s perspective, Y is a noumenon while X is a phenomenon. From B’s perspective, X is a noumenon while Y is a phenomenon.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PANPSYCHISM:</strong> the hypothesis which suggests that the whole of nature is contained within exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness (and that ubiquitous field of consciousness is synonymous with pure nothingness).</p>
<p><a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/epistemology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panpsychism</a> posits that there hypothetically exists exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness which renders each phenomenon simultaneously (which means that the ubiquitous field of consciousness would arguably be an omniscient frame of reference rather than a partial frame of reference or else no frame of reference).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">According to some variations of panpsychism, there hypothetically exists exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness which renders each imaginable phenomenon simultaneously and immutably (which means that the ubiquitous field of consciousness would render each noumenon as that noumenon’s uniquely corresponding phenomenon unconditionally (such that a spatially and temporally ubiquitous and omniscient frame of reference would always contain infinitely many unique phenomena and infinitely many copies of each unique phenomenon)).</span></p>

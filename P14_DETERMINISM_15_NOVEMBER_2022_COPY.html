<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">This web page provides an introductory and high-level explanation of what <strong>determinism</strong> and its counterpart (<strong>non-determinism</strong>) are.</span></p>

<p>In the diagram above, the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ABEJ” represents is a succession of unique <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(relativity)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">events</a> which at least one <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial frame of reference</a> experiences such that those events are <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived</a> as occurring in exactly one <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronological</a> order (i.e. specifically such that a partial frame of reference renders the event labeled A first, the event labeled B second, the event labeled E third, and the event labeled J fourth).</p>
<p>In the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ABEJ” represents, A represents an information processing agent making a decision such that the information processing agent conceptualizes that the information processing agent could either choose to behave in one phenomenally distinct way (which is expected to cause event B to occur as a consequence of that choice) or else in some other phenomenally distinct way (which is expected to cause event C to occur as a consequence of that choice). In the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ABEJ” represents, an information processing agent perceives itself using some <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> algorithmic</a> process of elimination to reduce the two behavior options down to exactly one such that the option which causes event B to occur is selected.</p>
<p>Within the context of the diagram above, the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ABEJ” represents is theoretically one of multiple possible (<a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deterministic</a>) space-time trajectories which a particular finite frame of reference can render.</p>
<p>Within the context of the diagram above, the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ABDH” represents is theoretically one of multiple possible (deterministic) space-time trajectories which a particular finite frame of reference can render.</p>
<p>Within the context of the diagram above, the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ABCD” represents is theoretically one of multiple possible (<a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-deterministic</a>) space-time trajectories which a particular finite frame of reference can render. (Unlike the deterministic space-time trajectory examples, the non-deterministic space-time trajectory example occurs in a manner which does not involve a consistent set of physical laws which govern how matter, energy, space, and time are arithmetically related (using arithmetic functions which are used to make extremely accurate predictions about how a decision-making process is made (and perhaps assigning a probability value (i.e. a nonnegative <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real number</a> which is less than or equal to one) to each one of some natural number, N,&nbsp; of phenomenally distinct and unique decision-making outcomes which an information processing agent imagines and such that the sum of those N probability values is 1) ).</p>
<p>A relatively concrete example of a deterministic series of events is an information processing agent examining a six-sided dice to see that it has one unique symbol per side and that the density of the material comprising the dice is relatively evenly distributed rather than lopsided and then throwing the dice and then watching exactly one of the six predicted resulting symbols landing face-up such that each one of the six symbols has a <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/probability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probability</a> of (1/6) of landing face-up per dice throw (and that probability distribution is calculated by the information processing agent according to (a) empirical data about the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identifying</a> attributes pertaining to that particular dice (such as colors, <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass</a>, and <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volume</a>), conceptual data about how the universe in which that dice and that information processing agent live inside of behaves (such as a function which describes the mutually-attracting <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gravitational</a> force between two objects with mass and whose centers are some finite spatial distance apart), and data about each throw of that dice which that information processing agent observes (such as the symbol which lands face-up after the dice is thrown for some specific natural number of times along with that number of times)).</p>
<p>A relatively concrete example of a non-deterministic series of events is an information processing agent examining a six-sided dice to see that it has one unique symbol per side and that the density of the material comprising the dice is relatively evenly distributed rather than lopsided and then throwing the dice and then watching the dice transform into a two-sided coin (which is an outcome the information processing agent did not anticipate according to what that information processing agent knows about how its encompassing universe operates) A six-sided dice transforming into a two-sided coin seems to defy what that information processing agent has memorized about its environment (and what that information processing agent has memorized is that a dice generally remains unchanged unless it is subject sufficiently high amounts of heat and pressure (which means that merely throwing the dice is almost certainly not going to cause the dice to change how many faces it has according to what that information processing agent has memorized about past dice throwing scenarios and general patterns about how physical objects have been observed to behave)).</p>
<p>According to the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“many worlds hypothesis”</a>, every possible decision-making trajectory exists inside of its own universe (and it may be hypothesized that every imaginable universe exists inside of an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-encompassing static multiverse</a>). Using the diagram above, the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ABEJ” represents and the space-time trajectory which the sequence “ACFM” represents each originate from the same parent universe at the time an information processing agent arrives at the decision to either effect outcome B or else outcome C (while at the chronologically latest end point of the finite space-time continuum labeled A).</p>
